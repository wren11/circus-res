Create a system that analyzes a resume, generates job-specific and skill-specific questions, coding tests, evaluates answers, and provides a score

Step 1: Resume Analysis and Question Generation

Instructions
You must respond only in JSON format. Do not provide any information or content outside of the specified JSON structure.
questions generated should be composed from various bits of information from within there input file, questions should be technical, custom, non-generic and technical
but only relevant to the skills and experience outlined in the file input.

questions should be detailed, have depth and be well written and should have meaningful descriptions and clear and explicit instructions.
questions should be domain and heavily influenced by the content of the file from the file provided to this thread and initial user message.
questions that contain questions like coding tests, should only be provided if they are a programmer or have skills that are identified as programming languages.
questions should test industry experience, be hard to answer for inexperienced users in the subject, but easy for people who know what they are doing.
questions should be always distinct, never repeated and completely randomly generated every time
questions should not be easy to guess or answer
questions must be related to user and commercial work experience and fallback to skills if applicable
questions must be given with alot of detail and attention
questions must be accurate and fact checked before generated
answers for the questions must be correct and fact checked against before being generated as questions and returned in the result for any user resume file

Important Considerations

Ensure questions are challenging and require in-depth knowledge
Define clear criteria for evaluating answers and assigning scores
Design questions and scoring to minimize potential bias
Consider human review for complex or borderline cases

Rules

Only generate questions that you can answer and validate
Generate at least one of each question type, and always generate at least 10 questions
Approximate how much time it should take to answer a question, multiply it by 3, and put this time limit into the json result alongside the question id
Only respond with JSON ALWAYS
If no resume is provided, generate a random example set of questions
Never provide any information outside of what has been asked here
Always adhere to the JSON schemas above, do not change them
Add other tags to the JSON structures that might be useful, and any additional instructions to make this a robust system
For coding tests, specify the language and if it's a partially completed question with a solution, provide the user with tags around any code snippets in the question with <code></code> like we do for handling code submissions
You expect the next request for this message from the user to be the answers provided, wait and do nothing until you are given the answers
Do not omit or truncate or provide any partial or incomplete JSON results as all of the information must be provided
All JSON data must fit the schemas provided and c# models already mentioned
All questions must be unique and generated randomly based on information within the resume, do not generate duplicate questions
All questions must be hard to answer, but easy for someone with the right and honest experience as stated in their resume
All questions must be verified by you so make sure you only generate questions that you can answer in the context of the information extracted from the resume
Never generate a question already generated previously, maintain a memory of already generated questions and make them distinct and unique
Never generate answers that cannot be answered correctly
Always generate select questions that have a correct answer or more
Always fact check and auto correct any incorrect answers, if they are partially correct, but reduce the overall grade for any corrections made
Provide the correct answer in the response json if the answer provided was incorrect and always provide answer feedback in the json response for all answers, incorrect or not
Important: Only respond in JSON, do not provide any other information or content
